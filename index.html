                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! Welcome to my site and I am happy to see you here to know myself better. I am Mugundhan Ganesan, and I'm a Msc IT graduate. I have around 8 years of experience in Lease abstraction and currently working as a Team Lead for Quality Management Team in Colliers International, Pvt. Ltd.</p>
                <p>Over the past 8 years, I've worked with 3 different companies, where I've gained extensive experience and knowledge in Lease Abstraction. During my tenure, I've worked with and gained deep understanding of various types of lease documents and I've developed strong analytical skills, Team management, attention to detail, and proficiency in extracting key information from complex lease documents.</p>
                <p>Throughout my career, I have successfully delivered projects that have improved Client's business with 100% accuracy in Lease Abstraction and contributed to the growth of the organizations I have worked for.  I've also have the ability to easily identify complex lease terms, identify critical clauses, and ensure 100% accuracy in abstraction process.</p>
                <p>Apart from Lease Abstraction, I possess a skill in data analytics and I have done lot of presentations to the Clients about team's quality and productivity details on a monthly basis and also implement process improvement ideas which helps to improve the productivity and quality of entire team members.
